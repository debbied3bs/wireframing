# 🧠 Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual guide or blueprint** for a website or app layout.  
It outlines the structure, content placement, and functionality **before** adding colors, graphics, or real content.

## Importance in the Design Process
- 🧭 **Clarifies structure** – helps visualize how different pages and components fit together.  
- 💡 **Saves time** – reduces redesigns later by catching layout issues early.  
- 🤝 **Improves collaboration** – allows designers, developers, and clients to agree on the layout before development.  
- 🔁 **Supports iteration** – easy to modify and refine design ideas quickly.

## Example Tools for Wireframing
- Figma  
- Adobe XD  
- Balsamiq  
- Sketch



## 🧩 Key Elements of a Wireframe

### 1. Layout Structure
This defines how the page is **organized and divided** — sections, columns, and spacing.  
**Example:** A homepage might have a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer.  
➡️ This helps designers visualize the hierarchy of information and how users will move through content.

### 2. Navigation
Represents how users will **move between pages or sections** of a site or app.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar with links like *Home*, *About*, *Services*, and *Contact*.  
➡️ Ensures smooth user flow and easy access to key information.

### 3. Content Placement
Shows where **text, images, and buttons** will be positioned on the screen.  
**Example:** Putting a “Sign Up” button near the top makes it more visible and encourages user interaction.  
➡️ Helps maintain visual balance and emphasizes important actions or messages.

### 4. Functionality
Indicates **interactive elements** like buttons, sliders, forms, or links.  
**Example:** Highlighting a “Search Bar” at the top of a page shows users can look up information quickly.  
➡️ Demonstrates how the product will respond to user actions and improve usability.


## 🧱 Types of Wireframes

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are **basic sketches or outlines** that show the rough structure of a page without focusing on visuals or details.  
They’re usually **black and white**, with simple boxes and placeholders representing elements like buttons or images.  

**When to use:**  
- Early in the design process to brainstorm layout ideas.  
- When you want **quick feedback** from teammates or clients.  
- Great for focusing on **functionality and structure** rather than aesthetics.

**Example:**  
A hand-drawn sketch on paper showing where the header, navigation, and content areas will go.

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are **detailed and polished** versions that include accurate spacing, colors, typography, and even interactive elements.  
They look close to the final design but may not be fully functional yet.  

**When to use:**  
- Later in the design process when layout decisions are finalized.  
- When presenting to stakeholders or developers for **handoff**.  
- Useful for testing **visual design and user experience** details.

**Example:**  
A detailed Figma prototype showing real images, styled buttons, and proper alignment.

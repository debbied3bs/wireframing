# 🧠 Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual guide or blueprint** for a website or app layout.  
It outlines the structure, content placement, and functionality **before** adding colors, graphics, or real content.

## Importance in the Design Process
- 🧭 **Clarifies structure** – helps visualize how different pages and components fit together.  
- 💡 **Saves time** – reduces redesigns later by catching layout issues early.  
- 🤝 **Improves collaboration** – allows designers, developers, and clients to agree on the layout before development.  
- 🔁 **Supports iteration** – easy to modify and refine design ideas quickly.

## Example Tools for Wireframing
- Figma  
- Adobe XD  
- Balsamiq  
- Sketch
